### Diodes

Diodes fail to to heat - Temperature

N-Type = Silicon + Phosphorus
P-Type = Silicon + Boron

N-Types have negative free carrieres ==> **Electrons** = **Donors**
P-Types have positive free carrieres ==> **Holes** = **Acceptor**

Silicon forward voltage : 0.7 V
Germanium forward volatage : 0.3V

Forward biased : Voltage flows from Anod to Cathod
Reverse biased : Voltage froms from Cathod to Anod
