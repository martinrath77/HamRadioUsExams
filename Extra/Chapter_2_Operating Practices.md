### **Split Operation**

Why split ?

- Because the DX station may be transmitting on a frequency that is prohibited to some stations

- To separet the calling statiosn from the DX station

- To improve operating efficiency by reducing interferences

### Before Calling

- Before calling, send your full call once ( twice if you hear others doing this successfully)

### **Know your Daily Propagation Shift**

- Higher Frequency bands during the day

- Lower FRequency bands at night

### **QSL Policy**

- ARRL LoTW

- Stateside QSL Manager -  Handles QSL cards for a DX Station

- The ARRL QSL bureau only manages QSL for DX contacts ( outside of the 48 states) 

### Contesting

- You do not have to submit a lot to operate in a contest

- Contest logging software : at the end of a contest, the software can generate a **Cabrillo** file for submission

- **Self-Spotting** may be prohibited by Contest Rules and is generaly considered poor form. 

- Contests are held on all bands except the warc bands ( (30m / 17m /12m).

### VHF-UHF Contesting

Higest level of activity is typically in the **weak signal segment** of the band (CW & SSB) near the **calling frequency** 

### Remote Operation

- No special Callsign ID is required. You are still at the station's Control Point.

- Satelittes have transponders - REceive on band of frequencies and outputs to another band of frequencies. 

- Transponders have a power "Budget" that is shared among all users.

- LEO ( Low Earth Orbit) as compared to geostationary (QO100)

- A LEO travelling from *<u>**South to North**</u>* towards the Equator is called an <u>***Ascending pass***</u>

- A LEO travelling from <u>***North to South***</u> towards the Equator is called a ***Descending pass***

- A node is when the pass crosses the Equator

- Orbital Period = The time for one orbit

- Satellites Mode :
  
  - Uplink / Downlink
  
  - V/U : Uplink VHF / Downlink UHF
  
  - U/V : Uplink UHF / Downlink VHF

- 2 Different types of transponders :
  
  - **Linear** : 
    
    - re-transmits a band of frequencies
    
    - Any modulation mode can be passed though continous carrier modes such as FM and RTTY are generaly avoided due to power bugdets
